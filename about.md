# About

This project, "In The Wake: A Digital Voyage," was built at the University of Miami's Digital Humanities Practicum. It is focused on creating a private, pedagogical tool that demonstrates how to turn a dense critical text into a multimedia text. The material of In the Wake is notably difficult, and can be very opaque to non-native speakers of English as well as readers who are unfamiliar with the many cultural references Sharpe makes. To ameliorate this issue, our group is pivoting to a more linear presentation.
