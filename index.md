Summary: In a time in which wokeness is increasingly gaining attention in our nation's political forums, the aim of this digital project is to create a new resource for the benefit of the public. The site converts quoted text from Christina Sharpe's monograph "In The Wake" into animated ASCII art visuals. It engages with wake work, with the intent of encouraging more discussion surrounding this important praxis that C. Sharpe has theorized.
---

**Full Description:** We are delighted to propose a digital extension to the groundbreaking monograph, _In the Wake: On Blackness and Being_ (2016). Like a murmuration, we aim to transform text transcribed from _In the Wake_ into ASCII art. The community of symbols for the ASCII art is created from quoted text. This text-to-art will then be generated into GIF files. The GIPHY animations will be arranged as a sequence, such as a moving ship made up of XML marked-up text or quoted words, to produce a dynamic online pictographic essay.
